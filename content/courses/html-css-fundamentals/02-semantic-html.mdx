# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML means choosing elements based on their meaning, not their default appearance. Every element in HTML has a purpose—a role in the document structure that browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies understand.

Using `<div>` and `<span>` everywhere is like writing a research paper entirely in plain text without headings, paragraphs, or citations. The content exists, but the structure is invisible.

## Block vs Inline: Flow and Phrasing

HTML elements fall into two fundamental categories based on how they behave in the layout flow.

**Block-level elements** (flow content) start on a new line and take up the full available width. They can contain other block elements and inline elements.

**Inline elements** (phrasing content) sit within the flow of text and only take up as much width as their content requires. They can only contain other inline elements or text.

```html
<!-- Block-level: each starts a new line -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<div>This is a division.</div>
<h2>This is a heading.</h2>

<!-- Inline: flows with surrounding text -->
<p>This is <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em> in a paragraph.</p>
```

This distinction matters because you cannot nest block elements inside inline elements. This breaks HTML rules:

```html
<!-- WRONG: block inside inline -->
<span>
  <div>Invalid nesting</div>
</span>

<!-- CORRECT: inline inside block -->
<p>
  This is <span class="highlight">valid</span> nesting.
</p>
```

## Sectioning Content

Sectioning elements divide your document into logical regions. They create landmarks that assistive technologies use for navigation.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Semantic Structure</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Site Title</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <article>
      <h2>Article Title</h2>
      <p>Article content goes here.</p>
    </article>

    <aside>
      <h3>Related Links</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/related">Related Article</a></li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>Copyright 2026</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Each sectioning element has a specific semantic purpose:

- **`<header>`**: Introductory content or navigation aids. Can appear multiple times (page header, article header).
- **`<nav>`**: Major navigation blocks. Not every list of links needs a `<nav>`—reserve it for primary site navigation.
- **`<main>`**: The primary content of the document. Only one `<main>` per page. Excludes repeated content like sidebars and navigation.
- **`<section>`**: A thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Represents a chapter, tabbed content, or distinct topic.
- **`<article>`**: A self-contained piece of content that could stand alone: blog post, news story, forum post, product card.
- **`<aside>`**: Tangentially related content. Sidebars, pull quotes, or related links.
- **`<footer>`**: Footer for its nearest sectioning ancestor. Can appear in articles, sections, or at the page level.

<Tip>
Screen readers let users navigate by landmarks (regions defined by semantic elements). A user can jump directly from `<nav>` to `<main>` to `<footer>` without reading everything in between. Using `<div>` instead removes these navigation shortcuts.
</Tip>

## Text Semantics

Choose text elements based on their semantic meaning, not their visual styling.

### Headings

Headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) create a document outline. They should form a logical hierarchy without skipping levels.

```html
<!-- WRONG: skipped from h1 to h3 -->
<h1>Page Title</h1>
<h3>Subsection</h3>

<!-- CORRECT: logical hierarchy -->
<h1>Page Title</h1>
<h2>Major Section</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
```

Use only one `<h1>` per page—it represents the main topic. Screen readers use heading structure for navigation. Search engines use it to understand content hierarchy.

### Emphasis and Importance

**`<strong>`** indicates importance, seriousness, or urgency. Screen readers may announce it with emphasis.

**`<b>`** applies bold styling without semantic meaning. Use for keywords in a review or product names—visual distinction without added weight.

**`<em>`** indicates stress emphasis, changing the meaning of the sentence.

**`<i>`** applies italic styling for technical terms, foreign phrases, or thoughts—visual distinction without emphasis.

```html
<!-- Semantic emphasis -->
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not touch live wires.</p>
<p>Make sure to <em>close</em> the door, not lock it.</p>

<!-- Visual styling without semantic weight -->
<p>The term <i>habeas corpus</i> is Latin for "you have the body."</p>
<p>Search for <b>React hooks</b> in the documentation.</p>
```

### Other Text Semantics

**`<mark>`** highlights text for reference purposes, like search results.

```html
<p>Results for "semantic HTML": <mark>semantic</mark> HTML improves accessibility.</p>
```

**`<time>`** represents dates or times in a machine-readable format.

```html
<p>Published <time datetime="2026-01-20">January 20, 2026</time></p>
```

**`<code>`** represents inline code fragments.

```html
<p>Use the <code>fetch()</code> function to make HTTP requests.</p>
```

## Lists

Lists structure related items. Choosing the right list type adds semantic meaning.

**Unordered lists (`<ul>`)** for items without inherent sequence:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>
```

**Ordered lists (`<ol>`)** for sequential items where order matters:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
  <li>Mix ingredients</li>
  <li>Bake for 30 minutes</li>
</ol>
```

**Description lists (`<dl>`)** for term-definition pairs:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>

  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
```

Description lists work for glossaries, metadata, FAQ sections—any content with paired terms and definitions.

## The Figure Pattern

The `<figure>` element represents self-contained content that's referenced from the main flow but could be moved without affecting meaning: images, diagrams, code listings, or quotes.

Use `<figcaption>` to provide a caption within the figure.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="dom-tree.png" alt="Visual representation of a DOM tree structure">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: The DOM tree for a simple HTML document</figcaption>
</figure>
```

```html
<figure>
  <pre><code>function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}</code></pre>
  <figcaption>Example 2: A simple greeting function in JavaScript</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The `<figure>` element groups content with its caption, creating an explicit relationship between them.

## Avoiding Divitis

**Divitis** is the excessive use of `<div>` and `<span>` elements when semantic alternatives exist. It makes your HTML less meaningful and harder to understand.

```html
<!-- Divitis: meaningless structure -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="title">About Us</div>
  <div class="nav">
    <div class="link"><a href="/">Home</a></div>
    <div class="link"><a href="/about">About</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <div class="text">We build things.</div>
</div>

<!-- Semantic: meaningful structure -->
<header>
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <p>We build things.</p>
</main>
```

The semantic version:
- Requires less markup
- Works without CSS
- Communicates structure to assistive technologies
- Creates navigable landmarks
- Expresses intent clearly

<Warning>
Using `<div>` and `<span>` is not wrong—they're generic containers for when no semantic element fits. But reaching for them first, before considering semantic alternatives, removes meaning from your markup. Start with semantic HTML. Use `<div>` and `<span>` only when you need non-semantic hooks for styling or scripting.
</Warning>

## Why Semantics Matter

Semantic HTML is not about satisfying validators or following arbitrary rules. It's about creating documents that work in contexts you cannot predict.

Your HTML might be:
- Read by a screen reader to a blind user
- Indexed by a search engine
- Rendered on a smartwatch or in a car dashboard
- Stripped of CSS on a slow connection
- Parsed by a browser extension
- Converted to PDF or ePub
- Displayed in reader mode

Semantic markup ensures your content remains meaningful across all these scenarios. The structure survives independent of presentation.

## Summary

- **Block vs Inline:** Flow content (block) starts new lines and can contain other blocks; phrasing content (inline) flows with text and can only contain inline elements.
- **Sectioning Elements:** Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to create meaningful document structure and navigation landmarks.
- **Text Semantics:** Choose `<strong>` for importance, `<em>` for emphasis, `<mark>` for highlights, and `<time>` for dates—each carries specific meaning beyond visual styling.
- **Lists Matter:** Use `<ul>` for unordered items, `<ol>` for sequences, and `<dl>` for term-definition pairs—structure clarifies relationships.
- **Figure Pattern:** Wrap self-contained content like images or code blocks in `<figure>` with a `<figcaption>` to create explicit relationships.
- **Avoid Divitis:** Reserve `<div>` and `<span>` for non-semantic styling hooks—start with semantic elements that communicate meaning without CSS.
