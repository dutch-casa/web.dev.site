        Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications are usable by
        everyone, including people with disabilities. It's not just about compliance
        with standards; it's about creating inclusive digital experiences.

        When we design with accessibility in mind, we make better products for all
        users. Features like keyboard navigation, proper heading structure, and
        descriptive link text benefit everyone, not just users with disabilities.

        The key to accessible web development is understanding that accessibility
        is not a feature to add at the end, but a fundamental principle to guide
        every decision from the start.
