## Progress Tracking

Your progress is saved locally in your browser. When you mark a lesson complete, it stays complete even after closing the browser.

<Note>
Progress data is stored in localStorage. Clearing your browser data will reset your progress.
</Note>

## Reading Progress Bar

Notice the thin bar at the top of the page. It shows how far you've scrolled through the current lesson.

<Warning>
The reading progress bar only tracks scroll position, not comprehension. Make sure you understand the material before moving on!
</Warning>
