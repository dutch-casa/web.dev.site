  <!--
    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Build a contact form that includes:

    1. A field for the user's full name (required, text input)
    2. A field for email address (required, must be valid email format)
    3. A field for phone number (optional, accepts phone format)
    4. A dropdown to select topic: "General Inquiry", "Support", "Feedback"
    5. A textarea for the message (required, minimum 10 characters)
    6. A checkbox to agree to privacy policy (required)
    7. A submit button

    Requirements:
    - All form controls must have proper labels
    - Use appropriate input types for validation
    - Mark required fields using HTML attributes
    - Group the privacy checkbox properly with a fieldset
    - The form should validate without JavaScript
    - Use semantic HTML throughout

    Hint: Think about which HTML attributes provide built-in validation.
