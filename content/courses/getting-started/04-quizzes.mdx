# Interactive Quizzes

Test your understanding with interactive quiz components.

## Multiple Choice

The simplest quiz format. Select the correct answer from the options.

<MultipleChoice
  question="What does the `readonly` modifier do in TypeScript?"
  options={[
    "Makes a property immutable after initialization",
    "Makes a property private",
    "Makes a property optional",
    "Makes a property required"
  ]}
  correct={0}
/>

## Fill in the Blank

Type the missing word or phrase. The answer is fuzzy-matched (small typos are forgiven).

<FillBlank
  question="The ___ keyword declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned."
  answer="const"
  fuzzyThreshold={2}
/>

<Tip>
Fill-in-the-blank uses Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching. A threshold of 2 means up to 2 character differences are allowed.
</Tip>

## Short Answer

For longer answers, use short answer questions. These use similarity matching.

<ShortAnswer
  question="Why is immutability important in functional programming?"
  expectedAnswer="Immutability prevents side effects and makes code easier to reason about. It enables referential transparency and simplifies concurrent programming."
  fuzzyThreshold={0.5}
/>

<Note>
If you think your answer was correct but the fuzzy matching disagreed, click "Actually, I was right" to override.
</Note>

## Quiz Independence

<Warning>
Quiz results are independent of lesson completion. You can mark a lesson complete without answering quizzes, and quiz answers don't automatically mark lessons complete.
</Warning>

## More Examples

Here's another multiple choice to practice:

<MultipleChoice
  question="Which hook should you use for data fetching in React?"
  options={[
    "useQuery (React Query)",
    "useEffect",
    "useState",
    "useMemo"
  ]}
  correct={0}
/>

And a fill-in-the-blank:

<FillBlank
  question="In TypeScript, ___ is used to define a union type."
  answer="|"
  fuzzyThreshold={0}
/>
