# Interactive Playground

Experiment with React code directly in your browser. This playground runs a complete Node.js development environment powered by WebContainers.

## What You're Learning

This example demonstrates core React concepts:

- **`useState`** - Managing state (the task list, input value)
- **Event handlers** - `onChange`, `onKeyDown`, `onClick`
- **Conditional rendering** - `{tasks.length === 0 && <p>...</p>}`
- **Derived state** - `completedCount` calculated from tasks
- **Immutability** - Using spread operator for updates

<Tip>
The playground runs completely in your browser using WebContainers. No installation required!

## Try It: Build a Counter

Click to expand the exercise below. Your task is to implement a counter using `useState`:

<Exercise id="counter-exercise" />

## Solution

Once you've tried implementing it yourself, here's the solution:

1. Replace `const count = 0` with `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`
2. In `increment`, call `setCount(count + 1)`
3. In `decrement`, call `setCount(count - 1)`

<Note>
The `useState` hook returns a pair: the current state value and a function to update it. When you call the update function, React re-renders the component with the new value.
