  <!--
    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Below is a paragraph with id="welcome" and class="intro".
    Multiple CSS rules target this element.

    Based on the cascade rules (origin, specificity, source order):
    1. What color will the text be?
    2. What font-size will be applied?
    3. Will the text be bold?

    Uncomment the CORRECT answers below. Think carefully about:
    - Which rule has the highest specificity for color?
    - Which rule wins for font-size based on specificity?
    - Which rule applies font-weight?

    Do not modify the CSS or HTML structure, only uncomment your answers.
